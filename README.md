This is a challenge to me, I try do build a disney + clone by using:
<br/>
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\
[Graph CMS](https://graphcms.com/)

by de future I will update this project using styles-components with typescript

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
